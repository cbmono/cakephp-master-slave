cakephp-master-slave
====================

Very easy to implement Master/Slave solution for CakePHP 2.3.x

After testing tons of solutions, doing this mashup (and refactoring), this ended up to be the most efficient and easiest solution for me. Specially the fact, that the slave connection is only defined once and not on every DB call.


Disclaimer: This isn't purely my code, but after so many changes, I can't tell anymore whose code I used to get to this - Sorry.
